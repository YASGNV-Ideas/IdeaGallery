Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Keep in mind that the idea which you are sharing can be implemented using some or the other computer science algorithm.
- If you submit a project that is similar to an existing project in the list, argument how it's better.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- The idea should be properly documented and the inspiration of the idea should also be mentioned if there are any.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[package](link) - Description.`
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- If there are any partial implementation of the idea do provide the implementation link.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Don't start the description with `A` or `An`.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the package and why it should be included.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request.

Thank you for your suggestion!
